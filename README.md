learning
========

Hello. My name is Sergey Ivanychev. I'm studying at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/), the department of control and applied mathematics.
My specialization is data analysis and machine learning. I love programming, maths and solving interesting
tasks. This repository contains my learning projects.

There are some that might be interesting:

* `./machine learning/paper` --- Writing "SVM Supermodelling paper". Project description, the data and the source code (Python) are available in the project folder.

* `./C++/CPU V4.1` --- Virtual CPU called **Ganymede** with its own bytecode and assembly compiler
* `./C++/Ganymede-x86 translator` --- Ganymede â†’ x86 binary translator. That thing enables us running Ganymede assembly programs on x86 machines natively.
* `./C/Colibri Compiler` --- Simple high-level programming definition that compiles to Ganymede assembly. These three projects combined turn to simple high-level language compiler.

* `./C/Derivative` --- symbolic differentiation of complex math formulas and converting them to PDF via LaTeX.

* `./C/Lunev/Remote` --- remote integral calculation using multiple computers in local network. Uses TCP/UDP + System V IPC

* `./C/Lunev/` --- multiple tasks completed during learning of Linux system programming

* `./SQL/ivDB*` --- multiple task completed during learning of SQL at the university course

*  Some minor pieces of code: `./Python/ipynb2pdf` is a utility that converts `.ipynb` files that contain russian language to PDF. `./Python/ivbot` is Telegram bot that can convert input LaTeX formula to PNG picture (see LaTeXing for OS X). `./Python/opt/*` and `./Python/S2GD` are optimization algorithm written during the university optimization course.

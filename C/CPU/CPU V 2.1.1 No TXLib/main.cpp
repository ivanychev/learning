	@version			1.1 Beta 2

	@par				Available commands (1.1 Beta 2) :
						- push {float number} or {ax, bx, cx, dx}	- pushes number to stack
						- pop  {out} - to the pointer or {ax, bx, cx, dx}
						- add
						- sub
						- mul
						- div
						- sqrt
						- pow
						- sin
						- cos
						- tan
						- out:
						-- out {name of register: ax, bx, cx, dx}
						-- out st    -  from stack
						-- out ch {number of ascii character}

	@par				Chengelog V1.1 Beta 1
						
						This version has got many new great features.
						
						-- Now the commands are being read from the file code.txt. 
						-- New processor functions added
							--	cpu_enter, cpu_cpace, cpu_tab for the cute output
							--	cpu_mov_ax which saves the number to processor register
						-- All the output is located in values.txt
						-- All mistake messages are located in log.txt
						--	If some mistakes happend during the instructions execution, calculator terminates, but
							the whole program doesn't. All mistakes messages and dump information you can find in log.txt

						Again,	code	- your commands
								values	- output
								log		- mistakes


	@par				Changelog V1.1 Beta 2

						This version has a lot of new features and updates
						-- TXLib fixes: dealing with broken calculator return (like 1/0 or sqrt(-4)). Now that points are being ignored and the plot is ok
						-- cpu_pop has been changed: now it doesn't print anything to any file stream. 
						-- cpu_out created: it can print in any file stream the value of stack, any register or character of input ascii number
						-- Error catcher updated: in calculator() function now the error function pointer is called, not the function. It makes possible to replace
						   the standard cpu_catch_error() function easily
						-- New plot() function: removed the code of drawing from main(), created new function
	
	@par				Changelog V1.1 Beta 3 RC
						
						-- CPU_CONSTRUCT and CPU_DESTRUCT fixed
						-- changes in CPU_OUT(). Now command sounds like "out ax" not "out rg ax"
						-- removed plot and "TXLib" support because its features have been shown in Beta 2. Compilation speed++
						-- CPU_MOV_AX() turned to CPU_MOV, now it deals with all registers (mov ax bx == ax = bx, mov ax 15 == ax = 15)
						-- CPU_POP enchanced: now you can pop from stack (pop st) and pop from any register (pop ax, pop bx)
						-- CPU_PUSH enchanced: now you can push your own value to the stack (push {number}) or push the value of any register (push ax)
						-- CPU_DUB() and CPU_SWAP() added support
						-- Code style changes - many local defines used
						-- Small fixes

	@todo				CPU Begin.exe process doesn't finish after stopping the program. It is still in memory. FIX OR ASK

The file cleveland.data has been unfortunately messed up when we lost
node cip2 and loaded the file on node ics.  The file processed.cleveland.data
seems to be in good shape and is useable (for the 14 attributes situation).
I'll clean up cleveland.data as soon as possible.

Bad news: my original copy of the database appears to be corrupted.
I'll have to go back to the donor to get a new copy.

	@version			1.1 Beta 1

	@par				Chengelog V1.1 Beta 1
						
						This version has got many new great features.
						
						-- Now the commands are being read from the file code.txt. 
						-- New processor functions added
							--	cpu_enter, cpu_cpace, cpu_tab for the cute output
							--	cpu_mov_ax which saves the number to processor register
						-- All the output is located in values.txt
						-- All mistake messages are located in log.txt
						--	If some mistakes happend during the instructions execution, calculator terminates, but
							the whole program doesn't. All mistakes messages and dump information you can find in log.txt

						Again,	code	- your commands
								values	- output
								log		- mistakes

Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.
how are your kith and kin today?
how bold or bashful there, and here
how brilliant with its instant tear!
How could she? why, he'd never heard...
How dull are acting and evasion,
how dull to work for the correction
How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
How early on he learnt to trouble
how envious was I of the waves
How fearful, in and out of season
how fearful, too, is my obsession
How heavy, and how near to sobbing,
how I interpret this expression:
How long he'd been here, was her query,
how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
how many follies were engendered;
how many lines of verse, and themes
How many times I made a toy
How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
How often on the steep Caucasian
How often would I fall to musing
How often, when the sky was glowing,
How often, with her sweet communion,
how pleasantly the stages pass.
how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
how sad the scar of passion's knife:
how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
How soft his glance, or at discretion
how soon the bounds of rank and station
how they remind me of your stem,
how to engage in talk that drew
How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
how well he knew the way to hurt --
how well she'd studied her new role!
However closely he inspected,
However has he earned so vicious,
however much her soul has faltered,
however scarlet; free from error
however strongly she has been

humbly I heard your lesson out?

I acted thoughtlessly or not:
I ask you, each and every poet!
I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
I could describe here his attire;
I count each hour the whole day through;
I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
I don't know why, but for my friend
I don't mean that she never shivered,
I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
I feel a brotherly affection,
I feel a small foot in my hand;
I find myself no longer equal;
I find no sense; the truth is this,
I gave my word, alas, though now
I gave no rein to sweet affection:
I grasp a stirrup with affection,
I had most surely never reckoned
I have no leisure to recall;
I have to drag my feet to it.
I hear the wrath of your reproach.
I hear you say. But can you see
I introduced my saucy Muse
I keep them, and will quote them here:
I kept in mind an ancient store
I know (and seek your exculpation)
I know it's now in your discretion
I know it, in the thoughts of all
I know to what malicious laughter
I know too surely how it ends.
I know your heart: it has a feeling
I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
I lack the strength required to say
I leave the verdict in your hand.
I like to tell the time by dinner
I liked his quality, the dream
I longed, like every breaker hissing,
I love my Tatyana too much!
I love their feet -- though I confess
I love you (what's the use to hide
I make magnanimous confession,
I married. I beseech you, go;
I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
I might have said a word, and then
I might have seen you, heard you speak
I move in the grand monde? that rank,
I must translate -- there's no presuming --
I must wake up with the conviction
I need to rest from all this rhyme:
I never lived or wrote for praise;
I only write like this, you know,
I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
I pray God grant his soul salvation,
I prize the attention of my friends,
I put your genius to the test,
I read with secret pain, and never
I really dote upon the word:
I regularly take much pleasure
I roam by the secluded lake.
I see another problem looming:
I shall set out on brand-new ways
I signal to each passing sail.
I still find Gallicism delicious
I suffered once from all the madness
I thank him without reservation,
I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
I trust my fate to your direction,
I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
I was just thirteen years of age.
I was Onegin's friend that season.
I weep, and pray for your protection..,
I would have chosen none but you
I would have found a friend, another,
I would have had the indiscretion
I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
I'd love you, but inside a day,
I'd not have known you, therefore I
I'd nothing to attract your humour...
I'd still like dances to this day:
I'll catalogue each simple saying
I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
I'll end my tale some other time.
I'll feed the journalists for dinner
I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
I'll gladden your imagination,
I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
I'll just remark, my verses talk
I'll make them spar another round,
I'll part them, bring them back together;
I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
I'll say: with past ideals in view
I'll set two ages by the ears.
I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
I'll stop that tempter from depraving
I'm altering my destination
I'm at your service to protect you;
I'm blind to every apparition;
I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
I'm grateful now with all my heart.
I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
I'm terrified -- so let it be...
I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
I've drawn a plan and a projection,
I've known too many a haughty beauty,
I've learnt new sadness; but in this
I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
I've no one here who comprehends me,
I've paid my due to classic art:
I've run a mile, I must avow,
I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
I've wasted too much life away!
Idle again by dedication,
Idol mio or Benedetta,
if her cross mood was at its worst --
if I had power to choose your fashion --
if I show wit in jesting thus.
if I'd possessed the slightest reason
if I, like you, had been a bard.
if not slow-witted, might have known.
If only Lensky'd known the burning
If suddenly aloft she spied
If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
if, motionless, no life appearing,
ignores approval's friendly clapping,

no proud pretentions to success,
No secret crimes, and no perditions,
No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
no softball for the winds of fashion,
no sound by which her soul is stirred.
no spark of fun in all its rot!
No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
no time to pick it up -- she's dying
no trace of ink, no spots, no stains.
no vision of her fields is dawning.
no vulgar epigram too much,
no word came flowing from his quill;
No word: another day goes by.
no years of absence past returning,
no, all devoured by passion's madness
No, all in her was calm and plain.
No, early on his heart was cooling
no, even her eyebrow never quivered,
no, forests are the sole retreat
No, I was born for peace abounding
No, incorrect and careless chatter,
No, never in the hottest fire
no, not for long were belles the ruling
no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
no, quite naively I'll retell
No, she's already pledged her word
No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
no, Tanya's more endearing far.

on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
on features known, but to that dreary,
on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
on foot, by seven o'clock, until
on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful
on her conquest, we leave my sweet;
on her smug face a flush of pleasure.
on jam, and speeches in regard
on kennels, and on kith and kin,
on liquor, and on hay brought in,
on me, all this has no effect:
on modish malice, coarse of grain

on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
on points that all long since agree --
on Richardson gone raving mad.
on springtime grasses of the field,

on state affairs; there was a wit,
On such indifference, such forgetting
on the cotillion, as amends.
on the dull life that bachelors lead;
On the first sheet you'll find a question:
on the highroad the wolves come out;
On the seashore, with storm impending,
On these, with something like obsession,
on this unstable life, my friends!
On this we'll part; goodbye again!
on tragedy; but it's no joke,
on unknown ladies in the tiers;
on visits to us, and in greeting
on waves of far niente floated,
on which a carpet has been spread,
on which the world is doomed to spin.
On whom alone can we depend?

Once home, he brought out and inspected
once I too liked it very much;
once more Corneille's majestic story;
once more he can't await the night;
Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
once more renounces world and din.
once more that touch is fiercely troubling
once more the love, once more the smart...
once more, at that beloved sight,
once on the highway he'd detected
Once Vyazemsky,4 who chanced to find her
once, with its foaming and its playing,
one customary grief each hour!
one customary object gleaming,
one day came down that lonely turning,
one finds in war amusing sport,
one leads the multitude in thought,
one listened to a chief of mission
One melancholy fop, declaring
one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
one raves in verse like me, and one
one sees a duck and aims his gun,
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
one wallows in delicious weeping;
Onegin -- now once more my theme --
Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
Onegin had no word to say;
Onegin has outrun us all.
Onegin knew enough to savour
Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
Onegin sits at table too,
Onegin spoke about its flights
Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
Onegin swiftly came to know
Onegin too -- and there to see,
Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
Onegin turns, and with a shiver
Onegin was assessed by many

Onegin, my good friend, was littered

Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --

only to Eugene showed their worth;

she burst into a coughing-bout.
she calls down curses on their leisure,
she can't escape at any pace --
she can't make out a single fraction
she can't; and in her panic hurry
she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
she did what nurse advised she do
she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
she drinks it like a priceless potion;
She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!

she flies no more, she's lost her strength.

She hesitates, and doubts beset her:

she looks, the room is getting light --
She looks: forgotten past all chalking
she lost the language of the gods
She loved the balcony, the session
she loved the steppe-land and its singing,

she never even bit her lip.

she sits down calmly on one side,
she sits with head sunk on her breast,
She sits with Nina8 at a table --
she speeds her footsteps to a race,

she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
She struck one as the incarnation --
she treads our earth, and how her breast
she trembles, and with fever drumming
she visited the humble tents
she walked across a snowy plain
she walked, but just as she was turning
She wanders on without direction.
She was alone, lit by the moon.
She was like him and always sported
she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
she went inside the empty shell
she won't inhale the powdered rime,
she wrote in French... what a confession!

She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
She's paid the sunrise no attention,
she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
she's turned up in my garden, bringing
she's up and flying through the air

your cold discourse, were less unkind --
Your curiosity is burning
your dashing one, is she surviving?''
your early life, unlock your tongue:
your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
your grief would fail to touch my heart,
your heart some self-restraint; for each
your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
your heroes, raging and ferocious,
Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
your loved one, honourable reader!
your matchlessness, to seek to capture
your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
your night of fretting's left no trace!
your presence aches, and in my blood!
your pride, some answer, or in truth
your soul displays, in holy dreams,
your Tanya's image in your mind,
your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
your words, and in my soul to explore
your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
yourself too long from social life.''
youth is a fever; we must spare
youth which has nothing to regret,
youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
youthful, who ripened in his time,
Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
Zaretsky draws up a convention
Zaretsky rose without discussion;
Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
Zaretsky, sometime king of brawls
Zhukovsky
Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
